## what is a branch in github?
### answer:
A branch is a parallel version of a repository (ie; it literally branches out or away from the main repository, kind of like a temporary sub-folder).

It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the "live" version.

## what does it mean to be semantic html?
### answer:
Introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them.

On the flip side of this equation, tags such as <b> and <i> are not semantic. They define only how the text should look (bold or italic), and don't provide any additional meaning to the markup.

i.e. footer, div,

## what is block level vs inline elements?
### answer:
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). (e.g. `<div>`)

An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary. (e.g. `<span>`)
  
An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!
