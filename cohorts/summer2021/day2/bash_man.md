# Bash Commands: `man`
Some of the help files are pretty big.

`man` opens a special browser to help you find what you're looking for. It's a little strange to use until you get used to it.

Here are the highlights:
* use arrow keys up/down to scroll line by line
* use pageup/pagedown (fn+arrow key on mac) to scroll page by page
* search with ```/```
* go to the next search result with ```n```
* go to the previous search result with ```Shift+n```
* quit the browser with ```q```
