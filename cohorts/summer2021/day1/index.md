Welcome to ABC Corp.

Here, in the engineering department, we design, code, and document the solutions sold by our sales and marketing teams.
We are a B2B (business to business) firm, which means that all of our clients are other businesses.

You guys are here because we just picked up a new client, XYZ Corp, who asked for an e-commerce site within the next 7 weeks.
We are the development team assigned to the XYZ project.

The account representative tells me that we should have the initial requirements tomorrow morning.
In the meantime, we'll get to know each other a little and discuss the way we do things here on all of our software projects.

My name is Dov Rine and I am the product owner.
Derrique Baluyut will be the Tech Lead for this project.
Please direct all suggestions, questions and comments to us.

We are going to have a lot of meetings interspersed with programming sessions.
I'll keep the meetings down to about 15 minutes as much as possible, but we'll take as long as we need.

Health, safety and efficiency are of top concern here.
Some of things you will learn are:
* ways to prevent repetitive stress injuries(RSI)
* ways to work efficiently on a laptop
* ways to work efficiently on multiple screens
* what kind of chair to use
* how to position your chair, keyboard, and monitor(s)
* the pomodoro technique
* quick exercises to use during breaks

As a rule, we will try to define things as we go along, but if there's ever anything that you don't understand, please ask immediately. Things move pretty fast around here and it's easy to get left behind, so don't be shy.

Since we don't want to have any legal or compliance issues, it's important to be sure that we are using current best practices and conforming to all applicable standards and guidelines.
Adhering to the same standards as everyone else also helps to ensure that our solutions will work with other solutions that our clients might already be using.

We will learn how to find, read, understand, and apply the standards and specifications in our solutions.

As you know, an e-commerce site is a web development project, so lets talk a bit about what the web is and how it works.

[Internet Client/Server Intro](internet_client-server_intro.md)

We have provided you with laptops that will be used for development. These modern laptops are very good but they still operate in fundamentally the same way as the original 8086 architecture CPU from the 1970s.
A basic understanding of the core parts of our laptops will help us to get this site out much faster and with fewer bugs.

So we talked about instructions loaded into memory from persistent storage so they can be executed by the processor, but what are these instructions and where do they come from?

[Algorithms 1](algorithms1.md)

Numbers are pretty important to everything we do with computers. We all think that we know numbers pretty well, but we need to be sure that we agree on them.

Guess what? There's a specification for that! (IEEE 754) so we don't have to guess. When we want to see how a number is defined or represented in the computer, we can just look it up.

Now, this particular specification is not free, it must be purchased, but there are many free online resources that allow us to find what we need to know and, in practice, you will probably never have to look at this spec in your entire career, but it's important to know where these things come from and how they work.

So, I know that we all know how to count in the human way, but computers count differently than us. Since our job is to tell computers to execute algorithms, we need to understand how they see things, too.

[Number Systems](number_systems.md)

I don't know about you, but I'm starting to get a little hungry. Let's break for lunch and meet back here in an hour.

So, before lunch we showed how information can be represented electronically using 1s and 0s on separate wires that we just logically grouped together. How do we measure electronic information?

[Computer Information Storage](computer_information_storage.md)

Now that we know how much data we have, how do we know what it means?

After all, if we just put a bunch of 1s and 0s in a row, how do we know if its supposed to be text, numbers, audio, video, a program to run, or something else?

[MIME types](mimetypes.md)

When we know that we have electronic data as 1s and 0s, it is said to be "encoded". There are lots of ways that data can be encoded and in order to decode it, we need a way to reverse the encoding or look it up somewhere.

One of the earliest, simplest, and most useful examples is how we encode english characters.

[ASCII](ascii.md)

Let's talk a little more about the persistent storage known as a hard disk drive or HDD.

[Persistent Storage](persistent_storage.md)

The last thing we have time to discuss today is how to work in the terminal. This is an enormous topic but we're going to take the approach of just learning how to use it for now, not why it works.

[Bash Basics](bash_basics.md)

Life is more than just work, so here at ABC we encourage a balanced lifestyle. We want everyone to enjoy being here as well as being productive.

We're going to stop a little early today so everyone can get to know each other better. Derrique and I are available if you have any questions.

We look forward to meeting all of you and making an awesome site for XYZ on time and on budget.

The day ends at 5pm so please stay until then and be back here tomorrow morning at 9am for the planning meeting.
