# phase 0: an array in memory

# make an api that fetches a list of todos with express with the following request methods

- GET
- DELETE
- POST
- PATCH

# phase 2: connect this to an actual database (create a db, create a todos table w/o user)

- GET
- DELETE
- POST
- PATCH

# phase 3: integrate this with a slice on the frontend in react

# phase 4: add a users table and alter the todos table to make it so todos have a user

- add a get request where it will only grab todos based on this new user
- dont forget to update the post request to also tie a user to the todo
