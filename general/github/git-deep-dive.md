# this is a dive into some common commands

- a quick note this in no way an extensive list of commands
- merely some commands in a real world repo
- I'd like to note the descriptions here are lacking you can investigate the commands further with the power of google!

- here's a nice article that explains the different lifecycles of git

## GUI tool

- in class we used a lot of terminal stuff when interacting with git, which is fine - but when doing more complicated stuff - sometimes you may want to work with something like git kracken

### a video below shows you how it works (warning they going into things you haven't heard of before like squash and tags)
