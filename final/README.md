# an opinionated high level breakdown...

1. User stories: to decide your features
   `as a user I want to do x`
2. low level wire frames to showcase features
3. database planning (what data do I need to store - and how does it relate to other data)
4. project scaffolding (FE and BE start)
5. BE table creation and data initialization
6. BE endpoint creation/conceptualization (think nouns and verbs: IE: I want to "GET" a list of "todos")
7. FE component planning
8. Ticket creation
9. Ticket assignment
10. FE connecting redux slices state and axios requests
